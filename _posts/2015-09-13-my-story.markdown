<p> I am cut from a different cloth than most of my friends. I am known as quite a simple girl, really. Rather typical in my ways. My long, blonde hair has a gentle, crimped wave that’s a little uneven in places. Be assured that my waves are nothing like the funky, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Horse" target="_blank"> Curly horse </a>crimp. Mine are quite tame by comparison. My saving grace is that the blonde is a <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/corn-stalks-corn-ears-corn-silk-833463/" target="_blank">corn silk </a>shade that older women often envy. These poor ladies try repeatedly to match it from drugstore boxes touting luscious joy and perfect bliss. They become exasperated by younger women in perfumed beauty salons, serving jasmine tea and blowing tiny, delicate bubbles with pink chewing gum while they prattle on about boyfriends, Netflix and gel nails (whatever they are). These silly youngsters swear to their patrons that they know the exact shade of gold they’re after, not realizing that their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Forever_Blowing_Bubbles" target="_blank">“forever blowing bubbles” </a>does little to give credibility to their burbling.</p>
<p>I’m not old enough to go to a beauty salon. I’m not sure I’ll ever want to, really. My hair seems to perfect to me – all the time. It’s always in place and the perfect length and colour. I feel the same about my delicate, pale skin. I once heard someone say it was so smooth and soft and felt like a <a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/" target="_blank">stick of butter</a> does when you run a warmed up finger along the top. What a delicious description! </p>
<p>Along with loving my hair and skin, I don’t feel the need to shop for more clothes, like a lot of girls do. I adore what I am wearing now. No silly shops for me. No boutiques where pushy people try to convince the unsure and bewildered that this or that is the perfect item that will bring them utter happiness – if only for a moment, but won’t that be worth it? My frock is plain blue with bright, summer flowers adorned across the front. It always falls just right, fits to a tee and never gets dirty. The puffy fullness of the skirt is like a roasted marshmallow at that moment when the gasses are bursting out just before the fire’s flame licks onto it to create the perfect, crispy crust. So satisfying. </p>
<p>Unlike Anna and Elsa, who have piles of money, I couldn’t be a shopaholic even if I wanted to be! Enjoy this little clip of their adventures in shopping.</p>

<p>And lastly, my simple shoes are the exact shade of the summer flowers on my dress and they’re oh so comfortable. They aren’t as fun as this cool chick’s from the <a href="http://www.fashioncraz.com/adidas-originals-by-jeremy-scott-fall-winter-2012-lookbook/" target="_blank">Jeremy Scott and adidas Originals Fall Winter 2012 collection</a>, but mine fit just right and show off my thin legs, making them seem more elegant rather than toothpickish. </p>
<p>Overall, my smile never wavers,  I am eternally happy and grateful, and always full of wonder. I feel I will live forever, for you see, I am a <a href="http://kimswitnicki.com/images/plasticene.png" target="_blank">plasticene girl</a>. Yellow and red and blue. And black and white too. And don’t forget the especially nuanced colours of my designer dough: flesh tone, periwinkle and teal. I may be one dimensional, but a more content and pliable girl you will never find.</p>
